# ðŸ¦´ Artifacts

### What is an Artifact?

<mark style="color:green;">**VQL**</mark> queries can be packages inside of mini-programs known as <mark style="color:green;">**Artifacts**</mark>. These are structured like YAML files and contain a query and a name attached to that query. This allows an investigator to search for a query by its name or description and simply run the query on the endpoint rather than needing to type the query into the UI.
